### Overview

This repository is a [research compendium](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3192v2) about a dataset that covers corresponding author country affiliations indexed in the Web of Science 2014 - 2018. The compendium contains all data, code, and text associated with it. The R Markdown files in the `analysis/` directory contain details about the data analysis, particularly about how the Web of Science in-house database from the [German Competence Center for Bibliometrics](http://www.bibliometrie.info/) was interface. The `data/` directory contains all aggregated data. Due to the proprietary nature of the Web of Science, only aggregated counts can be shared. 

### Analysis files

The `analysis` directory contains the following reports written in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/):

- [`paper.Rmd`](analysis/paper.Rmd) - The Data Descriptive including two use-cases

Analytical steps for obtaining the data from the Web of Science in-house database maintained by the German Competence Center for Bibliometrics (WoS-KB), and data enriching were also provided as R Markdown reports:

- [`001_kb_rp_pretest.Rmd`](analysis/001_kb_rp_pretest.Rmd) - Initial exploration about how corresponding authorships are represented in the Wos_KB
- [`002_kb_rp_coverage.Rmd`](analysis/002_kb_rp_coverage.Rmd) - Coverage analysis of reprint authors in the WoS-KB for the period 2014 - 2018
- [`003_kb_fetch_ca.Rmd`](analysis/003_kb_fetch_ca.Rmd) - Obtain and compile the dataset about corresponding author country affiliations 2014 - 2018
- [`004_kb_fetch_publisher.Rmd`](analysis/004_kb_fetch_publisher.Rmd) - Obtain and compile the dataset about the global publisher output 2014 - 2018

### Data files

The `data/` directory contains the resulting datasets stored as comma-separated value files

- [`rp_data_14_18.csv`](data/rp_data_14_18.csv) - Corresponding author country affiliations per publisher, journal and open access publishing model 2014 - 2018
- [`rp_jn_14_18.csv`](data/rp_jn_14_18.csv) - Corresponding author country affiliations per publisher and journal as provided by the WoS-KB
- [`publisher_14_18.csv`](data/publisher_14_18.csv) - Gloabl publisher and journal output 2014 - 2018 
- [`cr_wos.csv`](data/cr_wos.csv) - Matching table publisher and journal infos Crossref / Web of Science
